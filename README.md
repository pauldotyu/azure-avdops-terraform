# Overview

This repo will walk you through setting up the Azure infrastructure necessary to build custom images using Azure Image Builder and push to a Shared Image Gallery. You will need to have [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) either locally on your machine or you can clone this repo in your [Azure Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com) which already has Terraform installed.

# Setup

1. Read through these guides

   - https://github.com/marketplace/actions/build-azure-virtual-machine-image

   - https://github.com/Azure/build-vm-image

1. Make sure you have a service principal with the proper permissions in your subscription

   ```sh
   az ad sp create-for-rbac --name "myGitHubAction" --role contributor \
     --scopes <YOUR SCOPE> \
     --sdk-auth
   ```

   > Copy the contents to your clipboard

1. In your GitHub repo, head over to Settings and create a new Secret named `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` and paste in the content from the step above

1. Build your infrastructure using `terraform apply` from the root of this repo.

   > There is a `variables.tf` file in the root directory which contain default values for variables. You should overwrite the defaults with your own values by providing a file that ends with the name `*.auto.tfvars` or if you are running Terraform Cloud in a remote workspace, you can add variables which effectively act as your remote `*.auto.tfvars` file

# Build image using GitHub Action

1. Add a new GitHub Action and paste in the following for a basic Windows 10 multi-session image build. See the .github/workflows directory in this repo for customizing your build.

   ```yml
   name: create_custom_windows_image

   on: push

   jobs:
     azure-image-builder:
       runs-on: windows-latest
       steps:
         - name: Checkout
           uses: actions/checkout@v2

         - name: Azure login
           uses: azure/login@v1
           with:
             creds: ${{secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS}}

         - name: Build custom VM image
           uses: azure/build-vm-image@v0
           with:
             resource-group-name: "<YOUR RESOURCE GROUP>"
             managed-identity: "<YOUR USER ASSIGNED MANAGED IDENTITY>"
             location: "<YOUR AZURE IMAGE BUILDER LOCATION>"
             source-os-type: "Windows"
             source-image-type: "PlatformImage"
             source-image: microsoftwindowsdesktop:office-365:20h1-evd-o365pp:latest
             dist-type: "SharedImageGallery"
             dist-resource-id: "/subscriptions/<YOUR SUBSCIRPTION ID>/resourceGroups/<YOUR RESOURCE GROUP>/providers/Microsoft.Compute/galleries/<YOUR SHARED IMAGE GALLERY NAME>/images/<YOUR SHARED IMAGE NAME>"
             dist-location: "<YOUR SHARED IMAGE GALLERY REPLICATION LOCATIONS>"
   ```

# Build a new AVD Session Host using your new image

1. If you navigate to the https://github.com/pauldotyu/azure-avd-terraform repo, you'll find additional Terraform that you can use to build your AVD Workspace, Application Groups, Host Pool, and Session Hosts.

# Troubleshooting Tips

- If you encounter errors in the workflow but there is no meaningful error message, then head over to your subscription and check the activity log. Chances are you may be running into a policy action.

# Clean up

When deleting resources using the `terraform destroy` command, make sure you delete all image versions first.
